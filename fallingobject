package fallingobject;
/* English Description
/*This program computes the distance that an object will fall under Earth's 
gravity . Using the equation x(t) = 0.5 *at^2 +vt +x.
The variables are a= -9.8 , t = 15, v = 0, and x= 0.
The variables are casted as doubles and variable z
is declared as the final value of z = 0.5 * a*(t*t) + (v*t)+x;
Then z is printed out as "The object falls under Earth's 
gravity as:"+ z. /*
